# Problem 1

First, I’m loading the `penguins` dataset from the PalmerPenguins
package.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

-   The `penguins` dataset includes the variables: species, island,
    bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
    year. The variable of species has values: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo.
    The variable of flipper_length_mm has values such as 181, 186, 195,
    NA, 193, 190 mm and bill_length_mm has values such as 39.1, 39.5,
    40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3 mm.

-   The `penguins` dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns, indicating we
    have data on 344 different penguins and are measuring at most 8
    different traits in each penguin.

-   Across all penguin species, the mean flipper length is 200.9152047
    mm.

Using ggplot, I’m creating a labeled scatterplot of flipper_length_mm
(y) vs bill_length_mm (x), color-coded by species.
