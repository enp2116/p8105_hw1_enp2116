# Problem 1

First, I’m loading the `penguins` dataset from the PalmerPenguins
package.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

-   The `penguins` dataset includes the variables: species, island,
    bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex,
    year. The variable of species has values: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo.
    The variable of flipper_length_mm has values such as 181, 186, 195,
    NA, 193, 190 mm and bill_length_mm has values such as 39.1, 39.5,
    40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3 mm.

-   The `penguins` dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns, indicating we
    have data on 344 different penguins and are measuring at most 8
    different traits in each penguin.

-   Across all penguin species, the mean flipper length is 200.9152047
    mm.

Using ggplot, I’m creating a labeled scatterplot of flipper_length_mm
(y) vs bill_length_mm (x), color-coded by species.

# Problem 2

Creating a dataframe with a random sample of size 10 from a standard
Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the
sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length 10, and a factor
vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df = tibble(
  random_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  vec_logical = (random_samp > 0),
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "h", "i", "j", "k"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("single", "married", "married", "single", "divorced", "divorced", "single", "married", "married", "divorced"), levels = c("single", "married", "divorced"))
)
str(df)
```

    ## tibble [10 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ random_samp: num [1:10] -1.682 -1.066 0.769 -1.091 0.273 ...
    ##  $ vec_logical: logi [1:10] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE ...
    ##  $ vec_char   : chr [1:10] "a" "b" "c" "d" ...
    ##  $ vec_factor : Factor w/ 3 levels "single","married",..: 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 2 2 3

R allows us to take the mean of the random sample and of the logical
vector, counting TRUE as 1 and FALSE as FALSE.

``` r
mean(pull(df, random_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.4204308

``` r
mean(pull(df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.2

R does not allow us to take the mean of the character vector or of the
factor vector.

``` r
mean(pull(df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This is code that applies the as.numeric function to the logical,
character, and factor variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

-   When we make the logical vector numeric, we get 1s for TRUE and 0s
    for FALSE. This means we can interpret a mean of 0.5 to indicate
    TRUE occurs just as much as FALSE in the random sample.

-   When we make the character vector numeric, we get a string of NAs,
    which explain why we could not generate a mean.

-   When we make the factor vector numeric, we have our factors labelled
    as 1, 2, and 3 in the order that they were imposed in the creation
    of the dataframe. However, it makes sense that R does not
    automatically count the factors as numbers in generating a mean,
    since number assignment is arbitrary.
